Star Wars is an American epic space opera^ media franchise created by George
Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film^[b] and quickly became a
worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various
films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic
books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing
fictional universe.^[c] In 2020, its total value was estimated at US$70 
billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing media franchise of all
time.

The original film (Star Wars), retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope
(1977), was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)
and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars
trilogy. Lucas later returned to filmmaking to direct a prequel trilogy,
consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the
Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold
his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise.
The subsequently produced sequel trilogy consists of Episode VII: The Force
Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of
Skywalker (2019).

All nine films of the 'Skywalker saga' were nominated for Academy Awards with
wins going to the first two releases. Together with the theatrical live action
spin-off films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), the combined box office
revenue of the films equated to over US$10 billion and is currently the
second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.^^

Premise

The Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters "A long time ago
in a galaxy far, far away",^ in which humans and many species of aliens
(often humanoid) co-exist with robots, or 'droids', who may assist them in
their daily routines; space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed
hyperspace technology.^^^ Spacecraft range from small starfighters, to
huge capital ships such as the Star Destroyers, to space stations such as the
moon-sized Death Stars. Telecommunication includes two-way audio and
audiovisual screens, and holographic projections.

A mystical power known as the Force is described in the original film as "an
energy field created by all living things ... [that] binds the galaxy
together".^ Through training and meditation, those whom "the Force is strong
with" are able to perform various superpowers (such as telekinesis,
precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy).^ The Force
is wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi,
peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force
through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by
manipulating fear and aggression. While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark
Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are intended to be limited to two: a master and
their apprentice.^

Force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the population. The
Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called a lightsaber, a blade of energy
that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts. The rest
of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use laser-powered blaster
firearms. In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt
cartel are dominant. Bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters and
governments. Illicit activities include smuggling and slavery.

The Star Wars film series centers around three sets of trilogies, which are
collectively referred to as the "Skywalker saga".^ They were produced
non-chronologically, with Episodes IV–VI (the original trilogy) being released
between 1977 and 1983, Episodes I–III (the prequel trilogy) being released
between 1999 and 2005, and Episodes VII–IX (the sequel trilogy), being released
between 2015 and 2019. Each trilogy focuses on a generation of the
Force-sensitive Skywalker family. The original trilogy depicts the heroic
development of Luke Skywalker, the prequels tell the backstory of his father
Anakin, while the sequels star Luke's nephew, Kylo Ren.

An anthology series set between the main episodes entered development in
parallel to the production of the sequel trilogy,^ described by Disney
chief financial officer Jay Rasulo as origin stories.^ The first entry,
Rogue One (2016), tells the story of the rebels who steal the Death Star plans
just before Episode IV.^^ Solo (2018) focuses on Han Solo's backstory,
also featuring original trilogy co-protagonists Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian
and involving prequel trilogy villain Darth Maul.

Lucasfilm has a number of Star Wars films in development, two of which were
confirmed during Disney Investor Day 2020. The first will be a film titled
Rogue Squadron, which is being directed by Patty Jenkins, and is scheduled for
release on December 25, 2023.^ The second is an unspecified film from Taika
Waititi, who in May 2020 was announced to be directing a Star Wars film he was
co-writing with Krysty Wilson-Cairns.^ Additionally, a trilogy independent
from the Skywalker saga is being written by The Last Jedi writer/director Rian
Johnson.^^ In September 2019, it was announced that Kathleen Kennedy
and Kevin Feige would collaborate to develop a Star Wars film.^ In February
2020, a film was announced to be in development from director J. D. Dillard and
writer Matt Owens.^

The Skywalker saga

Original trilogy

Main article: Star Wars Trilogy
[74px-Mark]
[77px-PA-4]
[76px-Carr]
[69px-Jam]
The original trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Mark Hamill
(Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), and
James Earl Jones (Darth Vader's voice).

In 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the Flash Gordon serial,
but could not obtain the rights, so he began developing his own space opera.^
^[d] After directing American Graffiti (1973), he wrote a two-page
synopsis, which 20th Century Fox decided to invest in.^^^ By 1974,
he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay.^ The 1977
movie's success led Lucas to make it the basis of an elaborate film serial.^
 With the backstory he created for the sequel, Lucas decided that the
series would be a trilogy of trilogies.^ Most of the main cast would return
for the two additional installments of the original trilogy, which were
self-financed by Lucasfilm.

Star Wars was released on May 25, 1977, and first subtitled Episode IV: A New
Hope in the 1979 book The Art of Star Wars.^ Episode V: The Empire Strikes
Back was released on May 21, 1980, also achieving wide financial and critical
success. The final film in the trilogy, Episode VI: Return of the Jedi was
released on May 25, 1983. The story of the original trilogy focuses on Luke
Skywalker's quest to become a Jedi, his struggle with the evil Imperial agent
Darth Vader, and the struggle of the Rebel Alliance to free the galaxy from the
clutches of the Galactic Empire.

Prequel trilogy

Main article: Star Wars prequel trilogy
[78px-Ewan_]
[71px-Nata]
[73px-Hayd]
[75px-Ian_]
The prequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Ewan McGregor
(Obi-Wan Kenobi), Natalie Portman (Padmé Amidala), Hayden Christensen (Anakin
Skywalker),^[e] and Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine).

According to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were
developed during the outlining of the original two films.^ In 1980, Lucas
confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted,^ but due to the stress
of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by
1981.^ In 1983, Lucas explained that "There was never a script completed
that had the entire story as it exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would
take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and
I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday."^

Technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to
create computer-generated imagery (CGI), inspired Lucas to consider that it
might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequels
would be "unbelievably expensive."^ In 1992, he acknowledged that he had
plans to create the prequel trilogy.^ A theatrical rerelease of the
original trilogy in 1997 "updated" the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI
envisioned for the new trilogy.

Episode I: The Phantom Menace was released on May 19, 1999, and Episode II:
Attack of the Clones on May 16, 2002. Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, the
first PG-13 film in the franchise, was released on May 19, 2005.^ The first
two movies were met with mixed reviews, with the third being received somewhat
more positively. The trilogy begins 32 years before Episode IV and follows the
Jedi training of Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father, and his eventual fall from
grace and transformation into the Sith lord Darth Vader, as well as the
corruption of the Galactic Republic and rise of the Empire led by Darth
Sidious. Together with the original trilogy, Lucas has collectively referred to
the first six episodic films of the franchise as "the tragedy of Darth Vader".^


Sequel trilogy

Main article: Star Wars sequel trilogy

The sequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Adam Driver (Kylo
Ren), Daisy Ridley (Rey), John Boyega (Finn), and Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron).

Prior to releasing the original film, and made possible by its success, Lucas
planned "three trilogies of nine films."^^ He announced this to Time in
1978,^ and confirmed that he had outlined them in 1981.^ At various
stages of development, the sequel trilogy was to focus on the rebuilding of the
Republic,^ the return of Luke in a role similar to that of Obi-Wan in the
original trilogy,^ Luke's sister (not yet determined to be Leia),^ Han,
Leia,^ R2-D2 and C-3PO.^^ However, after beginning work on the
prequel trilogy, Lucas insisted that Star Wars was meant to be a six-part
series and that there would be no sequel trilogy.^^

Lucas decided to leave the franchise in the hands of other filmmakers,
announcing in January 2012 that he would make no more Star Wars films.^ In
October of that year, the Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and
announced that Episode VII would be released in 2015.^ The co-chairman of
Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, became president of the company and served as
executive producer of new Star Wars feature films.^ Lucas provided Kennedy
his story treatments for the sequels during the 2012 sale,^ but in 2015 it
was revealed Lucas's sequel outline had been discarded.^^ The sequel
trilogy also meant the end of the existing Star Wars Expanded Universe, which
was discarded from canon to give "maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers
and also preserve an element of surprise and discovery for the audience."^

Episode VII: The Force Awakens was released on December 16, 2015, Episode VIII:
The Last Jedi on December 13, 2017, and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker on
December 18, 2019, in many countries.^[f] The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi
were both critical and box office successes.^^ Episode IX received a
mixed reception from critics and audiences.^ The sequel trilogy starts 30
years after Episode VI and focuses on the journey of the Force-sensitive orphan
Rey, guided by Luke Skywalker. Along with ex-stormtrooper Finn and ace X-Wing
pilot Poe Dameron, Rey helps the Resistance, led by Leia, fight the First Order
, commanded by Han and Leia's son (and Luke's nephew), Kylo Ren.

Anthology films

Lucasfilm and Kennedy have stated that the standalone films would be referred
to as the Star Wars anthology series^ (though the word anthology has not
been used in any of the titles, instead carrying the promotional "A Star Wars
Story" subtitle). Focused on how the Rebels obtained the Death Star plans
introduced in the 1977 film, the first anthology film, Rogue One: A Star Wars
Story, was released on December 16, 2016, to favorable reviews and box office
success. The second, Solo: A Star Wars Story, centered on a young Han Solo with
Chewbacca and Lando as supporting characters, was released on May 25, 2018, to
generally favorable reviews and underperformance at the box office. Despite
this, more anthology films are expected to be released,^ following a hiatus
after 2019's The Rise of Skywalker.^

Television

The Star Wars franchise has been spun off to various television productions,
including two animated series released in the mid-1980s. Further animated
series began to be released in the 2000s, the first two of which focused on the
Clone Wars. After Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, only the later one
remained canon. Eight live-action Star Wars series will be released on Disney+.
The first, The Mandalorian, premiered on November 12, 2019. Star Wars won the
2020 Webby Award for Television & Film in the category Social.^ Disney+
later released the Ewoks movies and animated series, along the animated first
appearance of Boba Fett, and the Clone Wars animated micro-series in a section
called Star Wars Vintage, that section will also include the Droids animated
series in the future.^^ Certain aspects of the original Clone Wars
micro-series are considered to not contradict the canon, while others do.^

The Expanded Universe of spin-off media depicts different levels of continuity,
which were deemed non-canonical and rebranded as Legends on April 25, 2014, to
make most subsequent works align to the episodic films, The Clone Wars film,
and television series.^

In other media

Main article: Star Wars expanded to other media

From 1976 to 2014, the term Expanded Universe (EU) was an umbrella term for all
officially licensed Star Wars storytelling material set outside the events
depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video
games.^ Lucasfilm maintained internal continuity between the films and
television content and the EU material until April 25, 2014, when the company
announced all of the EU works would cease production. Existing works would no
longer be considered canon to the franchise and subsequent reprints would be
rebranded under the Star Wars Legends label,^ with downloadable content
for the massively multiplayer online game The Old Republic the only Legends
material to still be produced. The Star Wars canon was subsequently
restructured to only include the existing six feature films, the animated film
The Clone Wars (2008), and its companion animated series. All future projects
and creative developments across all types of media would be overseen and
coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of Lucasfilm created to
maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise.
^ Multiple comics series from Marvel and novels published by Del Rey were
produced after the announcement.

Print media

Star Wars in print predates the release of the first film, with the December
1976 novelization of Star Wars, initially subtitled "From the Adventures of
Luke Skywalker". Credited to Lucas, it was ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster.^
 The first "Expanded Universe" story appeared in Marvel Comics' Star Wars
#7 in January 1978 (the first six issues being an adaptation of the film),
followed by Foster's sequel novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye the following
month.

Novels

[170px-10]
 
Timothy Zahn authored the Thrawn trilogy, which was widely credited with
revitalizing the dormant Star Wars franchise.

After penning the novelization of the original film, Foster followed it with
the sequel Splinter of the Mind's Eye (1978). The novelizations of The Empire
Strikes Back (1980) by Donald F. Glut and Return of the Jedi (1983) by James
Kahn followed, as well as The Han Solo Adventures trilogy (1979–1980) by Brian
Daley,^ and The Adventures of Lando Calrissian trilogy (1983) by L. Neil
Smith.^^

Timothy Zahn's bestselling Thrawn trilogy (1991–1993) reignited interest in the
franchise and introduced the popular characters Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade
, Talon Karrde, and Gilad Pellaeon.^^^^ The first novel,
Heir to the Empire, reached #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list,^
and the series finds Luke, Leia, and Han facing off against tactical genius
Thrawn, who is plotting to retake the galaxy for the Empire.^ In The
Courtship of Princess Leia (1994) by Dave Wolverton, set immediately before the
Thrawn trilogy, Leia considers an advantageous political marriage to Prince
Isolder of the planet Hapes, but she and Han ultimately marry.^^
Steve Perry's Shadows of the Empire (1996), set between The Empire Strikes Back
and Return of the Jedi, was part of a multimedia campaign that included a comic
book series and video game.^^ The novel introduced the crime lord
Prince Xizor, another popular character who would appear in multiple other
works.^^ Other notable series from Bantam include the Jedi Academy
trilogy (1994) by Kevin J. Anderson,^^ the 14-book Young Jedi Knights
series (1995–1998) by Anderson and Rebecca Moesta,^^ and the X-wing
series (1996–2012) by Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston.^^^

Del Rey took over Star Wars book publishing in 1999, releasing what would
become a 19-installment novel series called The New Jedi Order (1999–2003).
Written by multiple authors, the series was set 25 to 30 years after the
original films and introduced the Yuuzhan Vong, a powerful alien race
attempting to invade and conquer the entire galaxy.^^ The bestselling
multi-author series Legacy of the Force (2006–2008) chronicles the crossover of
Han and Leia's son Jacen Solo to the dark side of the Force; among his evil
deeds, he kills Luke's wife Mara Jade as a sacrifice to join the Sith. Although
no longer canon, the story is paralleled in The Force Awakens with Han and
Leia's son Ben Solo, who has become the dark Kylo Ren.^^^^

Three series set in the prequel era were introduced for younger audiences: the
18-book Jedi Apprentice (1999–2002) chronicles the adventures of Obi-Wan Kenobi
and his master Qui-Gon Jinn in the years before The Phantom Menace; the 11-book
Jedi Quest (2001–2004) follows Obi-Wan and his own apprentice, Anakin Skywalker
in between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones; and the 10-book The
Last of the Jedi (2005–2008), set almost immediately after Revenge of the Sith,
features Obi-Wan and the last few surviving Jedi.

Although Thrawn had been designated a Legends character in 2014, he was
reintroduced into the canon in the 2016 third season of Rebels, with Zahn
returning to write more novels based in the character, and set in the new
canon.^^

Comics

Main articles: Star Wars comics and List of Star Wars comic books

Marvel Comics published a Star Wars comic book series from 1977 to 1986.^^
^^ Original Star Wars comics were serialized in the Marvel
magazine Pizzazz between 1977 and 1979. The 1977 installments were the first
original Star Wars stories not directly adapted from the films to appear in
print form, as they preceded those of the Star Wars comic series.^ From
1985 to 1987, the animated children's series Ewoks and Droids inspired comic
series from Marvel's Star Comics line.^^^ According to Marvel
comics former Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter, the strong sales of Star Wars comics
saved Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978.^ Marvel's Star Wars series was
one of the industry's top selling titles in 1979 and 1980.^ The only
downside for Marvel was that the 100,000 copy sales quota was surpassed
quickly, allowing Lippincott to renegotiate the royalty arrangements from a
position of strength.^

In the late 1980s, Marvel dropped a new Star Wars comic it had in development,
which was picked up by Dark Horse Comics and published as the popular Dark
Empire series (1991–1995).^ Dark Horse subsequently launched dozens of
series set after the original film trilogy, including Tales of the Jedi
(1993–1998), X-wing Rogue Squadron (1995–1998), Star Wars: Republic
(1998–2006), Star Wars Tales (1999–2005), Star Wars: Empire (2002–2006), and
Knights of the Old Republic (2006–2010).^^

After Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, it was announced in January 2014 that
in 2015 the Star Wars comics license would return to Marvel Comics,^ whose
parent company, Marvel Entertainment, Disney had purchased in 2009.^
Launched in 2015, the first three publications were titled Star Wars, Darth
Vader, and the limited series Princess Leia.^^^

First announced as Project Luminous at Star Wars Celebration in April 2019,
full details of a publishing initiative called Star Wars: The High Republic
were revealed in a press conference in February 2020. Involving the majority of
the current officially licensed publishers, a new era set 200 years before the
Skywalker Saga will be explored in various books and comics. These include
ongoing titles by Marvel and IDW Publishing, written by Cavan Scott and Daniel
José Older respectively, that will both premiere in August 2020.^

Further information: The Story of Star Wars and List of Star Wars books

The first Star Wars audio work is The Story of Star Wars, an LP using audio
samples from the original film and a new narration to retell the story,
released in 1977. Most later printed novels were adapted into audio novels,
usually released on cassette tape and re-released on CD. As of 2019, audio-only
novels have been released not directly based on printed media.^

Radio

Further information: Star Wars (radio)

Radio adaptations of the films were also produced. Lucas, a fan of the
NPR-affiliated campus radio station of his alma mater the University of
Southern California, licensed the Star Wars radio rights to KUSC-FM for US$1.
The production used John Williams's original film score, along with Ben Burtt's
sound effects.^^

The first was written by science-fiction author Brian Daley and directed by
John Madden. It was broadcast on National Public Radio in 1981, adapting the
original 1977 film into 13 episodes.^^^ Mark Hamill and Anthony
Daniels reprised their film roles.^^

The overwhelming success, led to a 10-episode adaptation of The Empire Strikes
Back debuted in 1983.^ Billy Dee Williams joined the other two stars,
reprising his role as Lando Calrissian.^

In 1983, Buena Vista Records released an original, 30-minute Star Wars audio
drama titled Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell, written by Daley.^^ In the
1990s, Time Warner Audio Publishing adapted several Star Wars series from Dark
Horse Comics into audio dramas: the three-part Dark Empire saga, Tales of the
Jedi, Dark Lords of the Sith, the Dark Forces trilogy, and Crimson Empire
(1998).^ Return of the Jedi was adapted into 6-episodes in 1996, featuring
Daniels.^^

Video games

Further information: Star Wars video games and List of Star Wars video games

The Star Wars franchise has spawned over one hundred^ computer, video, and
board games, dating back to some of the earliest home consoles. Some are based
directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical
Expanded Universe (rebranded as Star Wars Legends and removed from the canon in
2014). Star Wars games have gone through three significant development eras,
marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed
games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after
the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license
to Electronic Arts.

Early licensed games (1979–1993)

The first officially licensed electronic Star Wars game was Kenner's 1979
table-top Star Wars Electronic Battle Command.^^ In 1982, Parker
Brothers published the first Star Wars video game for the Atari 2600, Star
Wars: The Empire Strikes Back,^ followed soon the year later by Star Wars:
Jedi Arena, the first video game to depict lightsaber combat. They were
followed in 1983 by Atari's rail shooter arcade game Star Wars, with vector
graphics to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film.^
The next game, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1984), has more traditional
raster graphics,^ while the following Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back
(1985) has vector graphics.^

Platform games were made for the Nintendo Entertainment System, including the
Japan-exclusive Star Wars (1987), an international Star Wars (1991), and Star
Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1992). Super Star Wars (1992) was released for
the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, with two sequels over the next two
years.

LucasArts and modern self-published games (1993–2014)

Main article: LucasArts

Lucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for
adventure games and World War II flight combat games, but as George Lucas took
more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to
have more creative control over the games and founded his own development
company, LucasArts. Improved graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives,
which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original
narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and CGI cutscenes. In
1993, LucasArts released Star Wars: X-Wing, the first self-published Star Wars
video game and the first space flight simulator based on the franchise.^
It was one of the best-selling video games of 1993 and established its own
series of games.^ The Rogue Squadron series was released between 1998 and
2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films.

Dark Forces (1995), a hybrid adventure game incorporating puzzles and strategy,
^ was the first Star Wars first-person shooter.^ It featured gameplay
and graphical features not then common in other games, made possible by
LucasArts' custom-designed game engine, the Jedi.^^^^ The
game was well received,^^^ and it was followed by four sequels.^
^ The series introduced Kyle Katarn, who would appear in multiple
games, novels, and comics.^ Katarn is a former stormtrooper who joins the
Rebellion and becomes a Jedi,^^^ a plot arc similar to that of
Finn in the sequel trilogy films.^ A massively multiplayer online
role-playing game, Star Wars Galaxies, was in operation from 2003 until 2011.
After Disney bought Lucasfilm, LucasArts ceased its role as a developer in
2013, although it still operates as a licensor.^

EA Star Wars (2014–present)

Following its acquisition of the franchise, Disney reassigned video game rights
to Electronic Arts. Games made during this era are considered canonical, and
feature more influence from the Star Wars filmmakers. Disney partnered with
Lenovo to create the augmented reality video game Jedi Challenges, released in
November 2017.^^ In August 2018, it was announced that Zynga would
publish free-to-play Star Wars mobile games.^ The Battlefront games
received a canonical reboot in 2017. Jedi: Fallen Order was released in
November 2019 and Star Wars: Squadrons was released in October 2020.

Theme park attractions

Main article: List of Star Wars theme parks attractions

In addition to the Disneyland ride Star Tours (1987) and its successor, Star
Tours: The Adventures Continue (2011), many live attractions have been held at
Disney parks, including the travelling exhibition Where Science Meets
Imagination, the Space Mountain spin-off Hyperspace Mountain, a walkthrough
Launch Bay, and the night-time A Galactic Spectacular. An immersive themed area
called Galaxy's Edge (2019) opened at Disneyland and opened at Walt Disney
World in mid-2019.^ A themed hotel, Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, is
currently under construction at Walt Disney World.^

A multimedia project involves works released across multiple types of media.
Shadows of the Empire (1996) was a multimedia project set between The Empire
Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi that included a novel by Steve Perry, a
comic book series, a video game, and action figures.^^ The Force
Unleashed (2008–2010) was a similar project set between Revenge of the Sith and
A New Hope that included a novel, a 2008 video game and its 2010 sequel, a

card, and Star Wars role-playing games
[170px-George_Lucas_crop]
 
George Lucas made much of his fortune by retaining his rights to the
franchise's merchandising.

The success of the Star Wars films led the franchise to become one of the most
merchandised franchises in the world. While filming the original 1977 film,
George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in
exchange for full ownership of the franchise's merchandising rights. By 1987,
the first three films have made US$2.6 billion in merchandising revenue.^
By 2012, the first six films produced approximately US$20 billion in
merchandising revenue.^

Kenner made the first Star Wars action figures to coincide with the release of
the original film, and today the original figures are highly valuable. Since
the 1990s, Hasbro holds the rights to create action figures based on the saga.
Pez dispensers began to be produced in 1997.^ Star Wars was the first
intellectual property to be licensed in Lego history.^ Lego has produced
animated parody short films and mini-series to promote their Star Wars sets.^
 The Lego Star Wars video games are critically acclaimed bestsellers.^
^

In 1977, the board game Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star was released.^
^[k] A Star Wars Monopoly and themed versions of Trivial Pursuit and
Battleship were released in 1997, with updated versions released in subsequent
years. The board game Risk has been adapted in two editions by Hasbro: The
Clone Wars Edition (2005)^ and the Original Trilogy Edition (2006).^
Three Star Wars tabletop role-playing games have been developed: a version by
West End Games in the 1980s and 1990s, one by Wizards of the Coast in the
2000s, and one by Fantasy Flight Games in the 2010s.

Star Wars Trading Cards have been published since the first "blue" series, by
Topps, in 1977.^ Dozens of series have been produced, with Topps being the
licensed creator in the United States. Each card series are of film stills or
original art. Many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very
rare "promos", such as the 1993 Galaxy Series II "floating Yoda" P3 card often
commanding US$1,000 or more. While most "base" or "common card" sets are
plentiful, many "insert" or "chase cards" are very rare.^ From 1995 until
2001, Decipher, Inc. had the license for, created, and produced the Star Wars
Customizable Card Game.

Themes

See also: Star Wars sources and analogues

Star Wars features elements such as knighthood, chivalry, and Jungian
archetypes such as "the shadow".^ There are also many references to
Christianity, such as in the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws
heavily from traditional depictions of the devil.^ Anakin was conceived of
a virgin birth, and is assumed to be the "Chosen One", a messianic individual.
However, unlike Jesus, Anakin falls from grace, remaining evil as Darth Vader
until Return of the Jedi. According to Adam Driver, sequel trilogy villain Kylo
Ren, who idolizes Vader, believes he is "doing what he thinks is right".^
George Lucas has said that the theme of the saga is redemption.^

The saga draws heavily from the hero's journey, an archetypical template
developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell.^ Each
character—primarily Anakin, Luke, and Rey—follows the steps of the cycle or
undergoes its reversal, becoming the villain.^ A defining step of the
journey is "Atonement with the Father".^ Obi-Wan's loss of a father figure
could have impacted his relationship with Anakin,^ whom both Obi-Wan and
Palpatine are fatherlike mentors to.^ Luke's discovery that Vader is his
father has strong repurcussions on the saga and is regarded as one of the most
influential plot twists in cinema.^ Supreme Leader Snoke encourages Kylo
Ren to kill his father, Han Solo.^ Kylo uses the fact that Rey is an
orphan to tempt her into joining the dark side.^ According to Inverse, the
final scene in The Last Jedi, which depicts servant children playing with a toy
of Luke and one boy using the Force, symbolizes that "the Force can be found in
people with humble beginnings."^

Historical influences

Political science has been an important element of Star Wars since the
franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between democracy and
dictatorship. Battles featuring the Ewoks and Gungans against the Empire and
Trade Federation, respectively, represent the clash between a primitive society
and a more advanced one, similar to the Vietnam-American War.^^ Darth
Vader's design was initially inspired by Samurai armor, and also incorporated a
German military helmet.^^ Originally, Lucas conceived of the Sith as
a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the Schutzstaffel served
Adolf Hitler; this was condensed into one character in the form of Vader.^
Stormtroopers borrow the name of World War I German "shock" troopers. Imperial
officers wear uniforms resembling those of German forces during World War II,^
 and political and security officers resemble the black-clad SS down to
the stylized silver death's head on their caps. World War II terms were used
for names in the films; e.g. the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group
of encircled forces) and Hoth (after a German general who served on the
snow-laden Eastern Front).^ Shots of the commanders looking through AT-AT
walker viewscreens in The Empire Strikes Back resemble tank interiors,^
and space battles in the original film were based on World War I and World
War II dogfights.^

Palpatine being a chancellor before becoming the Emperor in the prequel trilogy
alludes to Hitler's role before appointing himself Führer.^ Lucas has also
drawn parallels to historical dictators such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon
Bonaparte, and politicians like Richard Nixon.^^^[l] The Great Jedi
Purge mirrors the events of the Night of the Long Knives.^ The corruption
of the Galactic Republic is modeled after the fall of the democratic Roman
Republic and the formation of an empire.^^

On the inspiration for the First Order formed "from the ashes of the Empire",
The Force Awakens director J. J. Abrams spoke of conversations the writers had
about how the Nazis could have escaped to Argentina after WWII and "started
working together again."^

    The aerial warfare of WWII inspired the space fights.

    The flag and iconography of the Empire resembles those of the Nazi Party
    and Germany during its rule.

Cultural impact

[200px-StormTrooper_Blaster]
The lightsaber and the blaster are iconic elements of the franchise.

The Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on popular culture,^ with
references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life.^
Phrases like "evil empire" and "May the Force be with you" have become part of
the popular lexicon.^ The first Star Wars film in 1977 was a cultural
unifier,^ enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.^ The film can be said
to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early
1980s, making science-fiction films a mainstream genre.^ The widespread
impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular
examples including Hardware Wars, Spaceballs, The Family Guy Trilogy and Robot
Chicken: Star Wars.

In 1989, the Library of Congress selected the original Star Wars film for
preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry, as being "culturally,
historically, or aesthetically significant."^ The Empire Strikes Back, was
selected in 2010.^^ 35mm reels of the 1997 Special Editions were the
versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of
transferring from the original prints,^^ but it was later revealed
that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical
releases.^

Industry

The original Star Wars film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was
credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's
release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th
Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the
company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million.^ The
franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a
thriving media conglomerate.^

Star Wars fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood
films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful
stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and irony to sprawling
special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film
industry in fundamental ways. Before Star Wars, special effects in films had
not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.^ The commercial success of Star
Wars created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s.^
 Along with Jaws, Star Wars started the tradition of the summer
blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many
screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important.^^
It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising
rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.^

Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book The Great Movies, "Like The Birth of
a Nation and Citizen Kane, Star Wars was a technical watershed that influenced
many of the movies that came after." It began a new generation of special
effects and high-energy motion pictures. The film was one of the first films to
link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to
build upon.^ Finally, along with Steven Spielberg's Jaws, it shifted the
film industry's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards
fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences.^^^

Some critics have blamed Star Wars and Jaws for "ruining" Hollywood by shifting
its focus from "sophisticated" films such as The Godfather, Taxi Driver, and
Annie Hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry
shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards blockbuster franchises with
multiple sequels and prequels.^ One such critic, Peter Biskind,
complained, "When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s
audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to
the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... They marched backward
through the looking-glass."^^ In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote
that through Star Wars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray cinema at
all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a
carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect", which was "a kind of
rebirth".^

The original Star Wars trilogy is widely considered one of the best film
trilogies in history.^ Numerous filmmakers have been influenced by Star
Wars, including Damon Lindelof, Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich, John Lasseter,^
 David Fincher, Joss Whedon, John Singleton, Kevin Smith,^ and later
Star Wars directors J. J. Abrams and Gareth Edwards.^ Lucas's concept of a
"used universe" particularly influenced Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) and
Alien (1979), James Cameron's Aliens (1986) as well as The Terminator (1984),
George Miller's Mad Max 2 (1981), and Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings
trilogy (2001–2003).^ Christopher Nolan cited Star Wars as an influence
when making the 2010 blockbuster film Inception.^

Fan works

Main article: Star Wars fan films

The Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon
material set in the Star Wars galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from
writing fan fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the
first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing
filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and
trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies,
mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan fiction films set in the Star Wars
universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the
submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.^ Lucasfilm has
allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not
attempt to make a profit.^

Academia

As the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known,
educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource. For
example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students
storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later
creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance.^
Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate
technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers.^
Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the US have advocated their use in
the university classroom to explain different types of psychopathology.^^
